## Synopsis
*Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and 
summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.*

## Data Processing
*There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and 
code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, 
your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot 
do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming 
you may consider using the `cache = TRUE` option for certain code chunks.*


```r
# data.table is required for one function only, "fread". We won't load the
# entire package because its namespace overlaps some other functions we use.
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
```


```r
df <- as_tibble(data.table::fread(file = "repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2"))
df <- rename(df, state_num = STATE__, longitude_e = LONGITUDE_)
names(df) <- tolower(names(df))
# these variables are all 0 and all NA, respectively
df <- select(df, -c(county_end, countyendn))

# standardize `evtype` to lowercase, removing spaces at beginning and end
# and removing extra internal spaces
df$evtype <- tolower(str_squish(df$evtype))
```

### Correcting `propdmgexp` and `cropdmgexp`

Damage amounts are represented in an unusual way. They are expressed in
scientific notation, with the base and exponent stored in separate variables.

The exponents, `propdmgexp` and `cropdmgexp`,  are supposed to
represent a power of 10, which is multiplied by `propdmg` or `cropdmg`
respectively to express a final damage amount. However, they actually
contain unusual values:


```r
sort(union(unique(df$propdmgexp), unique(df$cropdmgexp)))
```

```
##  [1] ""  "-" "?" "+" "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "B" "h" "H" "k" "K" "m"
## [20] "M"
```

After some investigation, it appears varying data entry standards or data
entry error has resulted in this state of affairs. A power of 10 will be
assigned to replace each of these symbols.

new <- c(NA,   1,   1,   10,  10,  10,  10,  10,  10,  10,  10,  10, 1e9, 1e2, 1e3, 1e6, 0)

ctmp <- toupper(df$cropdmgexp)

cnew <- rep(NA_integer_, length(ctmp)) # new vectors will be integers

for (i in 1:length(old)) {
    cnew[ctmp == old[[i]]] <- new[[i]]
    pnew[ptmp == old[[i]]] <- new[[i]]
}

df$cropdmgexp <- cnew
df$propdmgexp <- pnew
rm(ctmp, ptmp, cnew, pnew, old, new, i)
```

### Fixing `evtype`

In the documentation there are 48 official allowable `evtype` values.
In the dataset however, almost 1000 unique values exist. An examination of
these shows this to have resulted from manual data entry. For example:


```r
df %>% 
    count(evtype) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
    filter(str_detect(evtype, "blizzard")) %>% 
    head(n=7)
```

```
## # A tibble: 7 Ã— 2
##   evtype                             n
##   <chr>                          <int>
## 1 blizzard                        2719
## 2 high wind/blizzard                 6
## 3 heavy snow/blizzard                3
## 4 blizzard and extreme wind chil     2
## 5 blizzard/heavy snow                2
## 6 ground blizzard                    2
## 7 blizzard and heavy snow            1
```

We'd like to know if this is going to be a problem. For what proportion of 
records are the official designations for `evtype` not followed?


```r
types <- tolower(readLines("evtypes.txt")) # a list of official types
df %>% filter(! evtype %in% types) %>% nrow() / nrow(df)
```

```
## [1] 0.2958472
```
About 30% of the data is using some other designation for `evtype`. This is
a significant number and could certainly skew our analysis if one large category
were split into multiple smaller categories.

Let's count how many `evtype` strings have 100 or more observations in the dataset.
As a reminder, there are 902297 observations in total.

```r
fixtypes <- df %>% 
    filter(! evtype %in% types) %>%
    count(evtype) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
    filter(n >= 100) %>% 
    pull(evtype)
length(fixtypes)
```

```
## [1] 32
```

This is good news. We won't have to fix over 900 possible errors, just 32 of
them, to ensure a much more accurate analysis.

What we will do is work through these 32 types systematically and assign them,
using the documentation PDFs provided as part of the assignment, 
to correct `evtype`s. The others we will disregard as having too
small an effect on the analysis to matter. Let's first look at these names.


```r
fixtypes
```

```
##  [1] "tstm wind"              "thunderstorm winds"     "marine tstm wind"      
##  [4] "urban/sml stream fld"   "high winds"             "wild/forest fire"      
##  [7] "winter weather/mix"     "tstm wind/hail"         "flash flooding"        
## [10] "extreme cold"           "flood/flash flood"      "snow"                  
## [13] "landslide"              "fog"                    "wind"                  
## [16] "rip currents"           "storm surge"            "freezing rain"         
## [19] "urban flood"            "heavy surf/high surf"   "extreme windchill"     
## [22] "strong winds"           "dry microburst"         "coastal flooding"      
## [25] "light snow"             "hurricane"              "river flood"           
## [28] "record warmth"          "unseasonably warm"      "flooding"              
## [31] "astronomical high tide" "moderate snowfall"
```

Now we'll fix these incorrect designations by reassigning them to the
correct value.


```r
# map official evtypes to a vector of some incorrect names for that type
fixlist <- list(
    "thunderstorm wind" = c("tstm wind", "thunderstorm winds", "tstm wind/hail", 
                            "wind", "dry microburst"),
    "marine thunderstorm wind" = c("marine tstm wind"),
    "flood" = c("urban/sml stream fld", "flood/flash flood", "urban flood",
                "river flood", "flooding"),
    "flash flood" = c("flash flooding"),
    "coastal flood" = c("coastal flooding"),
    "high wind" = c("high winds"),
    "strong wind" = c("strong winds"),
    "wildfire" = c("wild/forest fire"),
    "winter weather" = c("winter weather/mix"),
    "extreme cold/wind chill" = c("extreme cold", "extreme windchill"),
    "heavy snow" = c("snow", "light snow", "moderate snowfall"),
    "debris flow" = c("landslide"),
    "dense fog" = c("fog"),
    "rip current" = c("rip currents"),
    "excessive heat" = c("unseasonably warm", "record warmth"),
    # from docs: "..caused by any combination of...high astronomical tide..."
    "storm surge/tide" = c("storm surge", "astronomical high tide"),  
    "high surf" = c("heavy surf/high surf"),
    "winter weather" = c("freezing rain"),
    "hurricane (typhoon)" = c("hurricane")
)

tmp <- df$evtype

# replace all the bad evtypes with official evtypes
for (officialtype in names(fixlist)) {
    for (badtype in fixlist[[officialtype]]) {
        tmp[grep(pattern = badtype, x = tmp)] <- officialtype
    }
}
df$evtype <- tmp
rm(tmp)
```

Previously, almost 30% of records had an incorrect `evtype`. Let's recalculate 
that proportion.

```r
df %>% filter(! evtype %in% types) %>% nrow() / nrow(df)
```

```
## [1] 0.003188529
```

Excellent! Only 0.3% of records have some unusual `evtype` from manual data
entry errors. We'll continue the analysis with this much-improved dataset, 
assuming that this tiny proportion of error won't skew our results significantly.


## Results
*There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.*

        

### Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

**Variables of interest**

Here we sum the fatalities and injuries by `evtype`, select the top ten,
and then plot the results.


```r
top_fatalities <- df %>% 
    group_by(evtype) %>% 
    summarise(fatalities = sum(fatalities)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(fatalities)) %>% 
    slice_head(n = 10)

top_injuries <- df %>% 
    group_by(evtype) %>% 
    summarise(injuries = sum(injuries)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(injuries)) %>% 
    slice_head(n = 10)
```


```r
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar=c(c(9, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1))

barplot(top_fatalities$fatalities, names.arg = top_fatalities$evtype, las=2,
        main="Fatalities: top causes")
barplot(top_injuries$injuries, names.arg = top_injuries$evtype, las=2,
        main="Injuries: top causes")
```

![](harmful_weather_files/figure-html/graph_injuries_fatalities-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
par(mfrow = c(1,1), mar=c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
```

In terms of both fatalities and injuries, **tornadoes are the most destructive
events to human health** in this dataset. 

However, knowing something of 
destructive US weather events one must ask **"Where are the hurricanes?"**

There is an important note in the FAQ:

>The fatalities, injuries, and damage amounts appearing in tropical cyclone events are
attributed only to wind damage experienced in the coastal counties/parishes listed. Other
tropical cyclone related events such as tornadoes and flooding are listed within their
separate event types.

**i.e. the deaths caused by hurricanes have deliberately been split up into 
multiple evtypes** and will show up as part of floods, lightning, wind, etc. 
Hurricane-spawned tornadoes are also included in the tornado events graphed above.
From the point of view of this dataset, hurricanes are a sort of 'meta-event'
that **causes** other events.

It is also worth noting that some similar events have different official
`evtype`s, e.g. **excessive heat** and **heat**, both of which show up in
the graphs above.

### Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

**Variables of Interest**

* `evtype`
* `propdmg`, `cropdmg`, `propdmgexp`, `cropdmgexp`


```r
df %>% 
    group_by(evtype) %>% 
    summarise(property = sum(propdmg * propdmgexp),
              crops = sum(cropdmg * cropdmgexp)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(property))
```
