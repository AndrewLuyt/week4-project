## Synopsis
*Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and 
summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.*

## Data Processing
*There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and 
code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, 
your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot 
do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming 
you may consider using the `cache = TRUE` option for certain code chunks.*

## Results
*There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.*
